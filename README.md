This repository contains the code of the EO4EU BiDS2025 tutorial on lightweight MOE-MAE for Earth Observation. The tutorial covers the following topics:
    - Introduction to EO4EU
    - Introduction to GEO-MOE-MAE
    - Setting up the environment
    - Loading and preprocessing the EuroSAT dataset
    - Extracting features using a pre-trained model
    - Exploring embeddings using t-SNE
    - Exploring specialization of experts
    - Building a similarity search database with ChromaDB
    - Performing image retrieval and visualization

The tutorial is implemented in a Jupyter notebook and can be run locally or on Google Colab. The notebook is designed to be interactive, allowing users to modify parameters and experiment with different settings. It can also be run on Pangeo infrastructure.
